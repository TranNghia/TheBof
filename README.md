Hi, 
Thank you for your interest in our work. 

Theses functions were built in order to analyse temperature data in order to determine incubation behaviour in avian species.

These functions are usable but need to be formated into a package format. Also, the functions need to be optimized in order to speed up the analysis process. Improvement can be made by  a more straighforward engineering process or vectorisation of the many loops.

If you have any modification, feel free to communicate with Nghia Tran at tran.ng91@gmail.com

Also part of the developpment process; Gabriel Pigeon and Fanie Pelletier
